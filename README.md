<h3 id="ci">Car Insurance</h3>
<p>This project is a very basic MVC web application using Entity Framework that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.</p>
