# Car Insurance

<p>This project is a very basic <strong>MVC web application</strong> using <strong>Entity Framework</strong> that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.</p>
